# # Binary Classification

This repository contains a binary classification project implemented using a Jupyter Notebook. The objective is to build a machine learning model that accurately classifies data points into one of two categories.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Notebook Name:** `Binary_Classification.ipynb`
- **Goal:** Build and evaluate a binary classification model using popular machine learning techniques.
- **Tools & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn


## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`

## ðŸ§  Features

- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Model training using algorithms such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of results

## ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation

- Trains multiple models and compares their performance
- Visualizes confusion matrix and classification reports

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/binary-classification.git
   cd binary-classification
